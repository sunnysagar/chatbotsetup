# AI ChatBot Project

## Project Overview
The AI ChatBot project is a web application developed using React.js for the frontend and Firebase for authentication, including Google Sign-In and email verification. It leverages the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) for backend services to manage user details, allow company registration, and provide various user interactions like fetching and updating user details. The app includes a live demo chatbot and incorporates animations to enhance the user experience. The application also uses Axios for API calls and implements authentication for secure user access.

The app is hosted on platforms like Netlify and Render for seamless deployment and real-time access.

## Hosted Demo
You can access the live demo of the AI ChatBot at the following URLs:
- **Netlify:** [https://ai-c-bot.netlify.app/]

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build an intelligent and interactive chatbot application that allows users to sign in, update their details, interact with the chatbot, and get personalized responses. The chatbot is integrated with a backend system to store and manage user data securely.

## Tech Used
- **Frontend:**
  - React.js
  - Axios (for API requests)
  - React Router (for navigation)
  - React Animation Libraries (for UI animations)
- **Backend:**
  - MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js)
  - Firebase (for Authentication - Google Sign-In & Email Verification)
- **Hosting:**
  - Netlify (for frontend deployment)
  - Render (for backend deployment)
  
## Features
- **User Authentication:**
  - Google Sign-In: only in destop.
  - Email/Password authentication and verification using Firebase
- **User Management:**
  - Add, get, and update user details
- **Company Registration:**
  - Companies can register and create profiles
  - Details should be like this Name- company URL: https://www.linkedin.com, description - Great company 
- **Dynamic URL-based Content:**
  - Page content and layout are dynamically rendered based on the URL
- **Live Chatbot:**
  - AI-driven chatbot capable of answering user queries
- **Animations:**
  - Smooth animations used for page transitions and chatbot interactions
- **Responsive UI:**
  - Fully responsive design for desktop and mobile views

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or above)
- Firebase account
- MongoDB account (or local MongoDB setup)
- Netlify and Render accounts for deployment

## Future Scope

- **Enhanced Chatbot Functionality:**
  - Integrate more advanced AI capabilities to handle complex conversations and provide more intelligent, context-aware responses, improving the overall user experience.
  
- **User Roles and Permissions:**
  - Implement different user roles (such as admin, company user, etc.) to provide varying levels of access and permissions. Admin users can manage company details, while regular users can update their profiles and interact with the chatbot.

- **Real-Time Chat:**
  - Add WebSocket-based real-time messaging to allow users to have uninterrupted, live conversations with the chatbot. This feature will enhance the interactivity and responsiveness of the chatbot system.

- **Advanced Analytics:**
  - Introduce an analytics dashboard to track and monitor user interaction patterns, chatbot usage, and performance metrics. These insights can be used to improve chatbot responses and user engagement.

- **Multi-Language Support:**
  - Add the ability to switch between multiple languages, allowing users to interact with the chatbot in their preferred language. The chatbot will automatically detect and respond in the chosen language based on user preferences.
